# Classify SMS Text messages Using Natural Language Processing


# Objective:

This project aims in implementing methods for spam-filtering in Python, on a dataset containing SMS data. This project uses Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook

It uses dataset of 5,572 labelled SMS, and a Random Forest Model for classification. It is developed in Jupyter notebook. ode for this project can be found in 'SMS classification(NLP).ipynb'.

An overall accuracy of 99% has been achieved.

# Required Software:

We will need scikit-learn, pandas and their dependencies already installed using pip.

The coding part is done using Jupyter notebook and all the necessary modules needed for this project are available there.

# Detailed Outline:

Reading a text based dataset into pandas 

Representing text as numerical data

Vectorizing dataset

Model building in scikit-learn

Evaluating a model

Comparing models
